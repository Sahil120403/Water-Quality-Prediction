# Water-Quality-Prediction
This project is focused on predicting water potability (whether water is safe to drink) using machine learning. It uses a dataset that includes features like pH, turbidity, and temperature, along with a target column indicating potability (1 for drinkable, 0 for not). Two different approaches are implemented: an LSTM-based neural network and a Random Forest classifier. The LSTM model processes the data as sequences to simulate time-based learning, while the Random Forest model treats each water sample independently. The Random Forest classifier is also connected to a simple Gradio interface that allows users to input values and get real-time predictions on water quality. The dataset used is stored in data.csv, and the implementation is provided in two Jupyter notebooks: water quality.ipynb for the LSTM model and Decision Tree.ipynb for the Random Forest model and interface. This project is a demonstration of how both deep learning and traditional machine learning can be applied to a real-world classification problem.
